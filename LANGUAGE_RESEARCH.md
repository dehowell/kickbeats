## Timing Requirements Analysis

### MIDI Standards
- **MIDI Clock Resolution:** 24 PPQN (Pulses Per Quarter Note) for sync
- **Common Sequencer Resolution:** 96-960 PPQN
- **Higher Resolution Example:** 960 PPQN = 3840 ticks per bar
- **Timing at 120 BPM with 96 PPQN:** Each tick = 5,208.3 microseconds (~5.2ms)

### Acceptable Thresholds (Music Production)
- **Jitter:** <1ms (above 1ms makes timing feel "untight")
- **Latency:** <15-17ms for comfortable live performance
- **Critical Factor:** Jitter is MORE important than latency for timing perception

### Project Requirement: Sub-10ms Timing
- **Target:** <10ms for seamless looping
- **Implies:** Need jitter well below 1ms for professional feel
- **Practical Target:** <0.5ms jitter, <5ms total latency

## Development Complexity Trade-offs

### Python: Faster Development, Runtime Complexity

**Development Speed:** Fast
- Rapid prototyping
- Quick iteration cycles
- Less boilerplate code

**Complexity Challenges:**
- **Timing Precision:** Must implement custom scheduling with absolute time tracking
- **GIL Workarounds:** Need multiprocessing or C extensions for parallelism
- **No Real-Time Guarantees:** Requires defensive programming and testing
- **Thread Management:** Need careful coordination between MIDI and UI threads

**Example Complexity:**
```python
# Must track absolute time to avoid drift
start_time = time.monotonic()
for event in events:
    target_time = start_time + event.time
    sleep_duration = target_time - time.monotonic()
    time.sleep(max(0, sleep_duration))
    midi_out.send_message(event.message)
```

**Risk Areas:**
- Event loop jitter accumulation over time
- GIL contention between threads
- No compile-time safety for concurrency
- Runtime performance unpredictability

### Rust: Upfront Complexity, Runtime Simplicity

**Development Speed:** Slower
- Steeper learning curve (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)
- More verbose code
- Longer compile times
- More time fighting the compiler

**Complexity Benefits:**
- **Compile-Time Safety:** Ownership prevents data races
- **Predictable Performance:** No GC pauses, deterministic memory
- **Real-Time Thread Priority:** Native support via audio_thread_priority
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** High-level code with C-level performance

**Example Complexity:**
```rust
// Ownership and lifetimes add upfront complexity
// but prevent entire classes of bugs
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
let midi_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
    // Compiler ensures no data races
    while let Ok(event) = rx.recv() {
        midi_out.send(&event.message)?;
    }
});
```

**Advantages:**
- Concurrency bugs caught at compile time
- Performance predictability
- Memory safety without runtime cost
- Better tooling for real-time requirements

**Risk Areas:**
- Higher initial development time
- More complex error handling
- Async runtime not hard real-time (but better than Python)
- Smaller community/fewer examples

## Decision: Rust 1.75+

### Rationale

For a real-time MIDI playback CLI tool with **sub-10ms timing accuracy** requirements, **Rust is the recommended choice** despite higher initial development complexity.

#### Critical Success Factors

1. **Timing Precision is Non-Negotiable**
   - Sub-10ms requirement is aggressive (8-10ms is 1 tick at 96 PPQN, 120 BPM)
   - Jitter must be <1ms to feel "tight" musically
   - Python's 1-10ms event loop jitter makes this challenging
   - Rust's deterministic behavior naturally achieves sub-millisecond precision

2. **Synchronization Complexity**
   - Click track + drum patterns require sample-accurate sync
   - Any drift or jitter between tracks is immediately noticeable
   - Python requires complex absolute-time tracking and defensive coding
   - Rust's ownership model and real-time thread support make this natural

3. **Long-Term Reliability**
   - Musical timing tools must be rock-solid reliable
   - Python's GIL and event loop jitter introduce ongoing maintenance burden
   - python-rtmidi has maintenance concerns (no updates in 12 months)
   - Rust's midir is actively maintained and provides stronger guarantees

4. **Performance Headroom**
   - Real-time audio/MIDI requires consistent performance under load
   - Python's GIL limits CPU utilization even with multiple cores
   - Rust's zero-overhead abstractions provide predictable performance
   - No garbage collection pauses to cause timing glitches

#### Why Not Python?

Python *could* work for this use case, but would require:
- Custom high-precision scheduling implementation
- Careful GIL management (multiprocessing or C extensions)
- Extensive testing to verify timing under various loads
- Defensive coding to handle timing jitter
- Potential maintenance issues with python-rtmidi

The sub-10ms timing requirement pushes Python to its limits, where Rust operates comfortably.

#### Trade-offs Accepted

**Higher Initial Investment:**
- 2-3x longer initial development time
- Steeper learning curve for Rust concepts
- More complex error handling

**Paid Back By:**
- First-time-correct timing behavior
- Compile-time prevention of concurrency bugs
- Predictable performance without tuning
- No runtime surprises (GC pauses, GIL contention)
- Better foundation for future features

#### Implementation Approach

**Recommended Stack:**
- **MIDI I/O:** `midir` + `wmidi` (for message parsing)
- **Terminal UI:** `crossterm` + `ratatui`
- **Async Runtime:** `tokio` (for non-blocking I/O coordination, NOT real-time scheduling)
- **Real-Time Thread:** Dedicated thread with `audio_thread_priority` for MIDI timing
- **Architecture:**
  - Real-time thread handles MIDI output (deterministic timing)
  - Async main thread handles UI and input (non-blocking)
  - Lock-free channels for communication

**Why This Works:**
- Real-time MIDI thread has zero GC, predictable memory, native thread priority
- UI/input in separate async context prevents blocking
- Rust compiler ensures no data races between threads
- Tokio handles non-critical I/O (terminal input/output)
- Critical timing loop stays simple and deterministic

---

## Conclusion

While Python offers faster initial development, the **sub-10ms timing accuracy** requirement makes Rust the clear choice. The project's core value proposition—precise, seamless looping—depends on timing guarantees that Python struggles to provide but Rust delivers naturally.

**The upfront investment in Rust pays dividends in:**
- Reliable, deterministic timing behavior
- No ongoing battles with GIL or event loop jitter
- Compile-time correctness for concurrency
- Predictable performance without tuning
- Professional-grade timing precision

For a tool where timing precision is the primary feature, Rust's deterministic performance and real-time capabilities make it the pragmatic choice despite the steeper learning curve.
