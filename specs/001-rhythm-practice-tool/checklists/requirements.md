# Specification Quality Checklist: Rhythm Practice Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Validation Details:

**Content Quality**:
- Spec avoids implementation details and focuses on WHAT and WHY
- User stories are written from musician's perspective
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 15 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-007 can be tested by measuring loop timing)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 10ms, 30 minutes, 95% uniqueness)
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes, not system internals
- Three prioritized user stories with acceptance scenarios cover main flows
- Five edge cases identified for error handling and boundary conditions
- Scope is bounded to kick drum patterns with click track in CLI environment
- Key entities defined (Pattern, Practice Session, Beat Grid)

**Feature Readiness**:
- Each functional requirement maps to one or more user stories
- User stories progress logically from P1 (core practice) to P3 (customization)
- Success criteria ensure feature delivers value (pattern variety, timing accuracy, quick feedback)
- Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout
