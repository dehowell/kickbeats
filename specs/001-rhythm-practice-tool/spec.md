# Feature Specification: Rhythm Practice Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-rhythm-practice-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a command line tool to help the user practice identifying rhythmic patterns by ear. The tool should generate a random kick-drum pattern, then play that pattern in a continuous, seamless loop via MIDI. When the user indicates they are ready to check their work, the tool should display an ASCII art representation of the beat it was playing. All playback should be accompanied by a click track."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Practice Basic Rhythm Recognition (Priority: P1)

A musician wants to improve their ability to transcribe kick drum patterns by ear. They launch the tool, which immediately begins playing a randomly generated kick drum pattern with a click track. The musician listens carefully, attempting to identify where the kick hits fall within the measure. When ready, they press a key to reveal the pattern, which appears as ASCII art showing the kick hits aligned with the beat grid.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the tool - the ability to practice rhythm recognition through repeated listening and verification. Without this, the tool has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the tool, listening to the generated pattern for any duration, then revealing the pattern. Success means the user can hear a rhythmic pattern and see its visual representation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the tool is launched, **When** playback starts, **Then** the user hears a kick drum pattern with click track playing in a seamless loop
2. **Given** a pattern is playing, **When** the user requests to see the pattern, **Then** an ASCII representation is displayed showing kick hits aligned with beat positions
3. **Given** the pattern is revealed, **When** the user compares the audio to the visual, **Then** the kick hits in the audio match the displayed pattern

### User Story 2 - Generate New Practice Patterns (Priority: P2)

After successfully identifying one pattern, the musician wants to continue practicing with a new, different kick drum pattern. They request a new pattern, and the tool generates and plays a fresh random pattern while maintaining the click track.

**Why this priority**: Continuous practice requires variety. Once a user has identified one pattern, they need new challenges to build their skills progressively.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by revealing the current pattern, generating a new one, and verifying that both the audio and eventual visual representation are different from the previous pattern.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pattern is currently playing, **When** the user requests a new pattern, **Then** a different random kick drum pattern begins playing immediately with no gaps in the click track
2. **Given** multiple pattern generations, **When** comparing patterns, **Then** each generated pattern is different from previous patterns in the session
3. **Given** a new pattern is playing, **When** the user reveals it, **Then** the ASCII representation matches the new audio pattern

### User Story 3 - Adjust Practice Session Settings (Priority: P3)

A musician wants to customize their practice session to match their skill level or focus on specific aspects. They can adjust parameters such as tempo, pattern complexity, and time signature before starting or between patterns.

**Why this priority**: While useful for progressive skill building, the core functionality works with reasonable defaults. This enhancement improves the tool's adaptability but isn't required for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting different parameters and verifying that generated patterns conform to those settings (e.g., slower tempo, simpler patterns, different time signatures).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user sets a slower tempo, **When** playback starts, **Then** the click track and pattern play at the specified tempo
2. **Given** the user requests lower complexity, **When** a pattern is generated, **Then** the pattern contains fewer kick hits and simpler rhythmic relationships
3. **Given** the user changes time signature, **When** a pattern is generated and revealed, **Then** the pattern and visualization reflect the correct number of beats per measure

### Edge Cases

- What happens when MIDI output device is not available or fails during playback?
- How does the system handle extremely fast or slow tempo settings that may cause timing issues?
- What happens if the user requests pattern reveal during the brief moment of pattern generation?
- How does the tool behave when run in an environment without proper terminal support for interactive input?
- What happens when the random pattern generator creates a pattern with no kick hits (all rests)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate random kick drum patterns with varying rhythmic complexity
- **FR-002**: System MUST play generated patterns via MIDI in a seamless, continuous loop
- **FR-003**: System MUST play a click track simultaneously with all drum patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a command to reveal the current pattern
- **FR-005**: System MUST display revealed patterns as ASCII art with kick hits aligned to beat positions
- **FR-006**: System MUST support generating new patterns on demand during a practice session
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure seamless looping with no audible gaps or timing drift between loop iterations
- **FR-008**: System MUST synchronize click track and kick drum pattern precisely
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain playback while waiting for user input
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to exit the practice session cleanly, stopping all audio
- **FR-011**: System MUST support configurable tempo settings (default 120 BPM)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support configurable pattern complexity levels (default medium)
- **FR-013**: System MUST support configurable time signature (default 4/4)
- **FR-014**: System MUST display clear instructions for available commands when starting
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle MIDI output errors gracefully with informative error messages (see contracts/cli-interface.md for detailed error format specifications)

### Key Entities

- **Pattern**: Represents a rhythmic sequence of kick drum hits and rests within one or more measures; includes timing information for each hit relative to the beat grid
- **Practice Session**: Represents a single user interaction with the tool; maintains current pattern, playback state, and user settings (tempo, complexity, time signature)
- **Beat Grid**: Represents the underlying rhythmic framework; defines the subdivision level (e.g., 16th notes) and beat positions for pattern generation and visualization

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can hear a generated pattern and reveal its visualization within 2 seconds of requesting it (measured from keypress to display completion)
- **SC-002**: Patterns loop seamlessly with timing accuracy within 10 milliseconds to prevent perceptible drift
- **SC-003**: Click track and kick pattern remain synchronized throughout extended practice sessions (30+ minutes)
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully generate and practice with at least 10 different patterns in a single session without errors
- **SC-005**: Generated patterns provide sufficient variety such that 95% of generated patterns are unique within any 20-pattern sequence
- **SC-006**: ASCII visualization clearly represents pattern timing such that users can accurately reconstruct the audio from the visual representation alone
