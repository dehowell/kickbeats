# Specification Quality Checklist: Web-Based Rhythm Practice Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Content Quality Assessment

- **No implementation details**: ✅ Spec focuses on Web Audio API and PWA as target platforms but doesn't specify frameworks, languages, or specific APIs beyond what's required by the user
- **User value focused**: ✅ All user stories emphasize musician practice needs and benefits
- **Non-technical language**: ✅ Written in terms of user actions and outcomes
- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ All sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- **No clarifications needed**: ✅ All requirements are fully specified with reasonable defaults applied
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ Each FR can be verified through testing
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ All SC items include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: ✅ SC items describe user-facing outcomes without implementation details
- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✅ Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Edge cases**: ✅ Nine edge cases identified covering browser compatibility, offline mode, audio context issues, etc.
- **Clear scope**: ✅ Feature boundaries are well-defined (web app recreating CLI functionality with PWA capabilities)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Implicit dependencies identified (Web Audio API support, PWA browser features, service worker capability)

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- **Acceptance criteria**: ✅ All FRs map to user stories with acceptance scenarios
- **User scenarios coverage**: ✅ Six user stories cover all aspects: playback, controls, PWA installation, settings, time signatures, cross-platform
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ 13 success criteria provide comprehensive coverage of performance, functionality, and user experience goals
- **No implementation leakage**: ✅ Specification maintains focus on what/why without prescribing how

## Notes

The specification is comprehensive and ready for either `/speckit.clarify` (if any questions arise during review) or `/speckit.plan` (to proceed with implementation planning).

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization (P1, P2, P3) enables phased development
- PWA requirements are well-specified without being overly technical
- Success criteria balance technical metrics (timing accuracy, performance) with user experience goals
- Edge cases demonstrate thorough consideration of real-world usage scenarios
