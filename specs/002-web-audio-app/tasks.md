# Tasks: Web-Based Rhythm Practice Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-web-audio-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack), spec.md (user stories), research.md (decisions), data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interfaces)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the spec, so test tasks are OMITTED from this plan. Testing will be done manually during development.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1, P2, P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web app structure: `web/src/`, `web/tests/`, `web/public/`
- All paths are relative to repository root

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - Core MVP
  - User Story 2 (P1): Depends on User Story 1 (extends playback with controls)
  - User Story 3 (P1): Can start after Foundational - PWA infrastructure (can be parallel with US1/US2)
  - User Story 4 (P2): Depends on User Stories 1, 2 (adds settings to existing functionality)
  - User Story 5 (P3): Depends on User Stories 1, 2 (extends pattern generation)
  - User Story 6 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Cross-cutting (touches all stories)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on completion of desired user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ TRUE MVP
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 (adds controls to playback)
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent PWA infrastructure
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Depends on User Stories 1, 2 (extends existing UI)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on User Stories 1, 2 (extends pattern system)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can work in parallel but requires testing all other stories

### Critical Path for MVP

1. Setup (Phase 1) ‚Üí 10 tasks
2. Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üí 9 tasks ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING
3. User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí 8 tasks ‚úÖ MVP COMPLETE
4. User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí 9 tasks (enhances MVP)
5. User Story 3 (Phase 5) ‚Üí 10 tasks (PWA features)

**Minimum Viable Product**: Complete through User Story 1 (26 tasks total including Setup + Foundational)

### Within Each User Story

- Models and utilities first (foundational tasks)
- Audio/core functionality next
- UI components in parallel (marked [P])
- Controller integration (depends on components)
- Styling and polish last

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup phase**: All tasks marked [P] (T003-T010) can run in parallel - 8 tasks
- **Foundational phase**: All tasks marked [P] (T011-T014, T016-T019) can run in parallel - 8 tasks
- **User Story 1**: T020, T021, T023 can run in parallel - 3 tasks
- **User Story 2**: T028, T029, T030 can run in parallel - 3 tasks
- **User Story 3**: T037, T038, T039, T045 can run in parallel - 4 tasks
- **User Story 4**: T047, T048 can run in parallel - 2 tasks
- **Polish phase**: Most tasks can run in parallel - 10+ tasks

**Total Parallel Opportunities**: 30+ tasks can be parallelized

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch audio modules in parallel:
Task: "Implement SoundSynthesis module in web/src/audio/SoundSynthesis.ts"
Task: "Implement AudioScheduler in web/src/audio/AudioScheduler.ts"
Task: "Create PlayButton component in web/src/ui/components/PlayButton.ts"

# Then integrate:
Task: "Implement AudioEngine in web/src/audio/AudioEngine.ts" (depends on audio modules)
Task: "Create PracticeController in web/src/ui/controllers/PracticeController.ts" (depends on components)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - Recommended Approach

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (10 tasks) ‚Üí Project structure ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (9 tasks) ‚Üí Core models and generators ready
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (8 tasks) ‚Üí **MVP: Play/pause pattern with audio**
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Load app in browser
   - Click play
   - Hear kick + click looping
   - Pause works
   - Deploy to test server with HTTPS
5. If validation passes ‚Üí Have working rhythm practice tool!

**MVP Scope**: 27 tasks for a functional web-based rhythm practice tool

### Incremental Delivery (Priority Order)

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational + US1 ‚Üí **MVP deployed** (basic playback)
2. **Sprint 2**: US2 ‚Üí Add pattern controls and notation reveal
3. **Sprint 3**: US3 ‚Üí Add PWA installability and offline support
4. **Sprint 4**: US4 ‚Üí Add tempo/complexity controls
5. **Sprint 5**: US5 ‚Üí Add time signature selection
6. **Sprint 6**: US6 ‚Üí Cross-platform polish
7. **Sprint 7**: Polish phase ‚Üí Production ready

Each sprint delivers independently testable value.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers after Foundational phase:

1. **Week 1**: Everyone completes Setup + Foundational together
2. **Week 2**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (core playback)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (PWA infrastructure - independent)
   - Developer C: Setup for User Story 2 (prepare components)
3. **Week 3**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (builds on completed US1)
   - Developer B: User Story 6 (responsive design - touches all)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (settings - extends US1/US2)
4. **Week 4**: User Story 5 + Polish

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no blocking dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Maps each task to specific user story for traceability
- **File paths**: All paths are exact and ready for implementation
- **TypeScript**: All .ts files, compiled by Vite
- **Testing**: Manual testing during development (no automated test tasks per spec)
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Each user story has a validation checkpoint
- **PWA requirement**: Must test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- **Audio challenges**: Web Audio timing is critical - validate <50ms drift requirement
- **Offline-first**: Pattern generation must work without network after initial load
